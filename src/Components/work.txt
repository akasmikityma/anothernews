make a navbar and add a button for searching news for categories and keyword  if any matches happen then it fethes the news related to it 
understatnd the loading.jsx and previous and next page function and try to implement that>>
try to imagine the design more and learn css more thats it for 6.30

option gets clicked and that very category's content shows up and then there is input where q is got and then  used in the api call 

so when i tried to make input based call that home page kind of crashed so first page's get mounted with general as its category 
and then as per the user input that category changes so the fetchNews method gets called inside the useEffect with category as a de
-pendency on the array .... may be that works ,, then i do the open source bootcamp 2 and then i do some dsa and then some job searching 
 and then create another thing or nothing
